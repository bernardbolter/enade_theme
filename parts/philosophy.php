			<h4>Philosophy of the Program</h4>
			<p>There is a reason why your efforts to maintain your weight loss keep getting sabotaged, and it is not because you are lazy, undisciplined, unmotivated, or genetically predisposed.</p>
			<p>The reason your weight loss efforts have not been successful is because you probably eat for reasons other than hunger. You could be triggered by emotional, psychological, physical, and situational cues that cause you to eat unnecessary food. This makes you fail at your diet and feel out of control. The key to feeling in control of your eating and weight is to become aware of your emotional triggers and learn strategies to manage your moods, feelings, and stressful situations. If you do not understand the reasons why you eat when you’re not hungry and learn how to effectively deal with these reasons, you will never be successful at maintaining weight loss.</p>
			<p class="program_quote">“While weight loss programs tell you what to eat, they do not address the reasons why we eat when we’re not physically hungry.”</p>
			<p>Diet programs provide a lot of useful information. Diets help you understand how much you need to eat to lose weight, the best structure for your eating, and the healthiest kinds of foods. These programs assume that the problem is that you don’t know what and how much to eat and that having this information will lead to weight loss and maintenance. However, for many people, it’s not that simple and diet programs alone are not enough. While weight loss programs tell you what to eat, they do not address the reasons why we eat when we’re not physically hungry. If you could stop eating when you’re not hungry, you would have already done it. You would be doing it now and not looking for yet another diet program.</p>
			<p>As an experienced clinical psychologist with a specialty in eating disorders, I offer a safe and comfortable place in which to explore your emotional eating and, without judgment, help you understand why you choose to cope with food. I created the Eating and Emotion Weight Management Program specifically to help you increase your awareness at the time you are eating when you’re not hungry and build the skills necessary to be able to prevent future emotionally-driven eating. I will help you learn how to deal with these feelings and situations so that you can be successful in meeting your non-food needs without eating.</p>
