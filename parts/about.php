			<p>a licensed clinical psychologist and have been in private practice in San Carlos, CA for over 20 years. I treat adults with a wide range of issues, including depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, relationship problems, and stress management. I also specialize in the treatment of eating disorders. While I treat the full spectrum of eating disorders, including anorexics, bulimics, and binge eaters, I have always had a special interest in those clients who are referred to as compulsive overeaters or emotional eaters. These individuals struggle with their eating but typically do not get as much attention from medical or eating disorder professionals.</p>
			<p>Through my extensive background and experience in the treatment of eating disorders, I have a thorough understanding of the issues that individuals encounter when dealing with emotional eating and feel confident in my approach to solving these problems. I have also had my own struggles in the past that provide me with a compassionate perspective on this issue. I understand through personal experience the frustration of going through diets and being successful at losing weight but unsuccessful at maintaining it. Based on my own experiences and professional expertise, I feel uniquely positioned to address this issue and provide the help that people truly need.</p>
			<p>My approach focuses on creating a safe environment where individuals feel comfortable sharing their experiences. I want my clients to learn how to feel good about themselves while working through some pretty difficult issues. I truly believe that this program is essential to gaining the level of self-awareness needed to successfully overcome emotional eating.</p>
