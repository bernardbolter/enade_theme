			<h4>Overview of The Program</h4>
			<p>The Eating and Emotion Weight Management Program utilizes a self-regulated eating approach. First, we will work on increasing your awareness of your current eating habits and patterns during discussions about your food entries for the week.  Typically, diet programs are not interested in examining your eating habits, but rather introduce a specific nutrition program that prescribes the types of foods and amounts you need to achieve weight loss.  Even when you are not dieting, you are probably using a diet mentality, that is, judging your eating and yourself by how well you are or are not following the guidelines. Once you begin to recognize how much your diet thinking dictates your eating, you will realize how these thoughts and feelings sabotage your weight loss and maintenance efforts.</p>
			<p>The next step in the self-regulated eating approach is to replace your diet mentality thinking with awareness of your body's internal eating cues of satiety, hunger, and fullness.  You will learn to depend on these physical eating signals to regulate your eating instead of relying on the "diet rules" that keep you in your head and not connected to your body.</p>
			<p>As your eating becomes more regulated, you will then be able to recognize when your eating has little or nothing to do with your physical eating cues.  These other cues may include emotional (sadness, loneliness, anger), environmental (food court at the mall), non-eating physical signals(sleep deprivation, stress, dehydration), or situational (birthday celebrations, dining out, holiday treats).  You will learn to develop coping strategies to effectively manage these triggers without overeating or binge eating.</p>
			<p>The ultimate goal of the self-regulated eating approach is for you to feel in control of your eating and confident in your ability to make the optimal food decisions for yourself.  The goal is not immediate and rapid weight loss.  Rather, you can expect gradual and permanent weight loss as your eating becomes more consistently self-regulated.  While it may take months to transition to self-regulated eating and stop overeating and/or binge eating, you will experience immediate and ongoing changes in your attitude and self-assurance to effectively manage your eating and weight.</p>
			<p>The Eating and Emotion Weight Management Program can take up to a year to complete successfully.  The first three months, weekly sessions are usually necessary.  During the next three months, the frequency can be decreased to bi-monthly sessions.  After six months, follow-up visits are scheduled on a bi-monthly or monthly basis as needed.</p>
			<p>Fees will be negotiated on an individual basis.  The program services may be covered by your health insurance.</p>
