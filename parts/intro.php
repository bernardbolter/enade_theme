	<p>With 25 years of experience in the field of eating disorders, Dr.Bolter has developed the Eating and Emotion Weight Management Program as an effective alternative to traditional weight loss programs.  Diets often fail because they primarily focus on changing what you eat and very little on how and why you make decisions about your eating.  Not addressing the underlying motivations that drive your eating choices stands in your way of achieving permanent weight loss.  The Eating and Emotion Weight Management  Program is designed  to help you gain the self-awareness needed to recognize and manage your emotional eating triggers and change your eating behavior forever. If you chronically struggle with your eating and weight and you are tired of yo-yo dieting, this program is for you!</p>
